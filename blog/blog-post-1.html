                    <hr />
                  
                    <h3>🧩 Decoding Cognitive Distortions</h3>
                    <p>
                      Have you ever thought:
                      <br>– “I’m such a failure,”
                      <br>– “They must hate me,”
                      <br>– “They think I’m fat,”
                      <br>– “Do you even like me?”
                      <br><br>
                      …even when there's no real evidence behind it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Welcome to the world of <strong>cognitive distortions</strong> — mental shortcuts that twist reality and quietly sabotage your <em>mood, confidence, relationships, and ultimately, yourself</em>.
                    </p>
                  
                    <h3>What Are Cognitive Distortions?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Cognitive distortions are <strong>irrational thought patterns</strong> that reinforce negative thinking and emotions. They often surface during times of <strong>stress, anxiety, or depression</strong> — and worst of all, they feel <em>true</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But they aren’t.
                      <br>
                      Our brains sometimes oversimplify, jump to conclusions, or assume the worst — creating a <strong>distorted version of reality</strong> that shapes how we feel and behave.
                    </p>
                  
                    <h3>🔟 Common Types of Cognitive Distortions</h3>
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>All-or-Nothing Thinking:</strong> Seeing things in black-and-white. <em>“If I don’t succeed completely, I’m a total failure.”</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Overgeneralization:</strong> Making broad assumptions based on one event. <em>“I didn’t get the job — nothing ever works out for me.”</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Mental Filtering:</strong> Focusing only on the negatives. <em>“I made one mistake — my whole presentation was terrible.”</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Disqualifying the Positive:</strong> Rejecting positive experiences. <em>“They were just being nice — they don’t really mean it.”</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Jumping to Conclusions:</strong> Assuming what others think (mind reading) or expecting the worst (fortune telling).</li>
                      <li><strong>Catastrophizing:</strong> Expecting disaster. <em>“What if I panic during the interview and ruin everything?”</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Emotional Reasoning:</strong> Believing that feelings = facts. <em>“I feel worthless, so I must be.”</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Should Statements:</strong> Using rigid rules. <em>“I should never feel anxious. I must always be strong.”</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Labeling:</strong> Defining yourself/others by one event. <em>“I’m an idiot for doing that.”</em></li>
                      <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Blaming yourself for things outside your control. <em>“They’re upset — it must be because of me.”</em></li>
                    </ol>
                  
                    <h3>🌿 Why It Matters</h3>
                    <p>
                      These aren’t just “bad thoughts” — they <strong>fuel anxiety, depression, and low self-worth</strong>. Believing them shapes how we behave… and keeps us stuck.
                    </p>
                  
                    <h3>🛠 How to Fight Back</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>✅ Become aware:</strong> Start noticing your thoughts. Ask: <em>“Is this 100% true?”</em></li>
                      <li><strong>✅ Challenge the distortion:</strong> Replace “I always mess up” with “Sometimes I struggle, but I learn and improve.”</li>
                      <li><strong>✅ Practice self-compassion:</strong> Mistakes don’t make you less worthy. Be kind to yourself.</li>
                      <li><strong>✅ Talk it out:</strong> Therapy (especially <strong>CBT</strong>) can help reframe these patterns.</li>
                    </ul>
                  
                    <h3>✨ Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>
                      Your thoughts are powerful — but not always accurate. By identifying and challenging cognitive distortions, you can shift your mindset and reclaim your emotional well-being.
                    </p>

                      <em>You are not your thoughts. You are the thinker who can change them.  
                      <br>So be wise… and re-think.</em>
